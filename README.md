2. Users can add photos of their experiences. A user must log in to add photos
3. Homepage will show a list of all countries
4. Clicking on a specific country will show attributes such as exchange rate, best time to visit, cost of an inexpensive meal, cost of a night at a hostel, and capital city

**Post-MVP:**
